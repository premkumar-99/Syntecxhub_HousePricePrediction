# 🏡 House Price Prediction — Syntecxhub Internship (Week 1)

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Syntecxhub**.  
For Week 1, I completed **Project 1: House Price Prediction**, where I built a Linear Regression model to predict median house values using the California Housing dataset.
